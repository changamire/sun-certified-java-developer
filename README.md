# Sun Certified Java Developer exam 2005
Way back in 2005 I passed the Sun Certified Java Developer exam which was pretty good going back then.

This repo contains the instructions from Sun at docs/instructions.html, and my submission based on the requirements from Sun.

For my efforts a got this tie/lapel? pin.
